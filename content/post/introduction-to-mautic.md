### what is mautic?

Mautic is an open source marketing automation platform.

Like its competitors, Hubspot, Marketo, Pardot and others, it can automate marketing processes.

Those processes that are repetitive and difficult.

Email marketing, social media marketing, lead generation, tracking and scoring, and more.

The difference between Mautic and its competitors is that Mautic is completely free.

The source code is available.

Because of this, it is theoretically possible to customize it at a source code level if necessary.
